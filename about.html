                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fortville was founded in 1865 and has a rich history tied to Cephas Fort who made the original plat survey of Fortville on his property in 1849.
                        He anticipated the arrival of the railroad, which came in 1852 and was named the Bee Line.
                        The railroad station was named Fortville in honor of Cephas Fort, causing the town center to shift somewhat south and east.

                    <p>
                        Early Fortville thrived on agriculture, with the fertile surrounding lands producing corn and wheat. The Blue River played a vital role in the town's early transportation and industry.

                    <p>
                        In the late 19th century, Fortville experienced a period of growth due to the establishment of a local college. This led to the construction of many of the historic buildings that still stand in the downtown area.
