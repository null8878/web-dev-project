                    <h3>Attractions</h3>
                    <p> Fortville has a variety of attractions for visitors to enjoy. Flatfork Park has been an attraction to the town for as long as I've known, and it's a great spot to go sledding in the winter since it boasts a large hill to slide down; and in the summer, when the pond isn't frozen, it's a great place to hang out and fish with some friends or by yourself. No only is it peaceful, you also have a great view of the countryside. It also has a trail that you can walk and explore nature.</p>

<p>The Memorial Park of Fortville is also another great attraction. It's a park that offers a lot of fun and useful things to the community, like the community center that is located within the park. It is used for recreational purposes for the kids, and it offers them a variety of activities to complete. The park itself has a  trail for visitors to walk, a skate park for the older kids, and a playground for the smaller ones. This park has a large slide built into the side of a hill, and it is downright fun. You’re blissfully sliding down the slide, enjoying the moment. This part is also used to host pickleball games, baseball, and soccer, so this is truly a one-stop shop. It’s something for everyone.</p>

                    <h3>Dining</h3>
                    <p>From casual eateries to fine dining, Fortville offers a range of culinary experiences.We have just about everything you could imagine: Mexican, Chinese, Asian, American, pizza, and Indian. I personally enjoy Los Megulas; it's a Mexican eats place here in town, and the food and service are amazing. It’s one of the spots I would visit if I was coming to Fortville. Another great spot that locals love is the Du Lit; they offer a variety of options for you to choose from. No only do they have something for everyone, it’s also a healthier alternative to fast food .</p>

                    <h3>Events</h3>
                    <p>Stay up-to-date on the latest events happening in Fortville. During the summer months the town has events like Farmers Markets on Main St where vendors sell a plethor of items like fruits, veggies, freeze dried candy and much more.</p>

<p>Another event that takes place in the town is called Kammy's Cause. What this event is, is a fantastic opportunity for the community to come together for a great cause and spend some money and help families in need. Partially, those are diagnosed with the rare chromosome disorders, particularly 4p- syndrome. It's a whole thing; the streets get filled to the brim and roads get shut down, and  the participants enjoy the opportunity to help.</p>
